# RepeatNoMore

**AI-powered knowledge assistant that captures team wisdom and stops the endless cycle of repeated questions.**

## 📈 Business Outcomes

| Outcome | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Capture Team Knowledge** | Every Q&A, decision, and insight gets automatically preserved in a searchable knowledge base |
| **Instant Answers** | New team members get answers in seconds, not hours of searching Slack or waiting for seniors |
| **Knowledge Stays With The Team** | When people leave, their expertise remains. No more losing critical knowledge |
| **Save Senior Developer Time** | Stop paying $150+/hour engineers to answer the same questions repeatedly |

## 😤 The Pain We Solve

Every development team knows these frustrations:

- 🔄 **"We already discussed this last month..."** — Important decisions get lost in chat history
- 👋 **"The person who knew this left"** — Critical knowledge walks out the door
- ⏰ **"I spend half my day answering the same questions"** — Seniors become expensive FAQ machines
- 🔍 **"I know this is documented somewhere..."** — Information scattered across Slack, Confluence, emails

### The AI Knowledge Gap

Yes, AI can answer questions today. But **specific knowledge** — your custom framework, project decisions, internal architecture — lives in the heads of your seniors and architects.

**AI can only give good answers if it works from maintained internal documentation.**

### The Documentation Paradox

> *"Everybody wants to go to heaven, but nobody wants to die."*

**Everybody loves getting their questions answered promptly.**
**Nobody wants to update the documentation.**

RepeatNoMore solves this: it captures knowledge *as a byproduct of answering questions*, not as a separate chore.

## 🔧 How It Works

```
User asks question → RAG retrieves relevant docs → LLM generates answer → User accepts → Knowledge saved
```
